# Paper-Review
Each folder mentions the name of the dataset used and after going into the folder checkout the file name and file name has all the hyper-parameters used in that particular code. I used 2 dataset Caltech and MITIndoor for similar and Flowers for dissimilar. I used Dogs Dataset for Hyperparameter coupling.

 I used BATCH_SIZE = 16 instead of 256 given in the paper. I trained models upto a point where I can verify a particular model is better or worse than the other.
