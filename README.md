# Paper-Review
Each folder mentions the name of the dataset used and after going into the folder checkout the file name and file name has all the hyper-parameters used in that particular code. I used 2 dataset Caltech and MITIndoor for similar and Flowers for dissimilar. I used Dogs Dataset for Hyperparameter coupling.
